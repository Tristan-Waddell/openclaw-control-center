- Preference update: x-publisher workflow is research-first (articles + Reddit + credible web sources), draft via communications, and NEVER post on Tristan's behalf; return tweet here for manual posting.
- Preference update: x-publisher tweets should be explanatory and educational (information provider tone), with concrete takeaway/value over hype.
- Control Center project command rule: if Tristan says "control center project pause" (or equivalent), pause all related execution; if he says "control center project resume" (or equivalent), resume from the project board file at projects/control-center-project-board.md.
