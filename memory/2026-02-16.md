## Durable updates
- Generated FairSeed nationwide lead deliverables:
  - `fairseed_leads_200.csv` (200-row lead sheet)
  - `fairseed_leads_200_notes.md` (sourcing approach + caveats)
- Added reusable skill: `skills/lead-finder-general/` with:
  - `SKILL.md`
  - `references/query-patterns.md`
  - `references/qualification-rubric.md`
  - `assets/lead_sheet_template.csv`
- Ongoing infrastructure note: gateway is consistently running, but service config still warns about nvm-managed Node path; recommended remediation remains `openclaw doctor --non-interactive` (or `--repair`).
- New preference from Tristan: for content/copy requests like LinkedIn posts, route through the `communications` subagent first, then return the result.
- Communications style preference: avoid formulaic contrast phrasing like “It isn’t X, it’s Y.” in generated copy.
- Applied the copy-style rule directly to `workspace-communications/AGENTS.md` under structural red flags to enforce it at prompt level.
- Added new reusable skill `skills/secure-web-browsing/` to enforce untrusted-content handling and prompt-injection-safe web research defaults.
- User preference: automatically use `secure-web-browsing` whenever a web link is accessed or whenever web content may be untrusted/high-risk.
- Content preference update: for communications copy, route through `communications` subagent; avoid implying experience in strategy/product/operations; keep recruiter-facing copy shorter and punchier.
- Seniority preference: position Tristan at associate level (not manager, not senior IC) unless he explicitly asks otherwise.
- Infra note: Chromium is installed and detectable, but browser tool startup can still intermittently timeout via gateway browser service; manual `/snap/bin/chromium` headless launch on CDP port 18800 worked as a fallback.
- Tristan requested overnight focus on: (1) improving skills library + subagent selection via external sources, (2) researching and planning PackCrafter.ai (Minecraft modpack creator), and (3) continuous self-improvement recommendations; requested one concise update at 9:30 AM America/New_York.
- Scheduled one-shot cron job `overnight-ai-improvements-and-packcrafter-update-930am` for 2026-02-16 14:30 UTC to send the requested consolidated update.
- Delivered the requested 9:30 AM ET overnight progress update covering completed skill/routing improvements, PackCrafter.ai planning status, in-progress research, and immediate next steps.
- Morning weather automation fallback triggered because web weather source was unavailable (missing Brave search API key), resulting in one concise motivational fallback message.
- Tuned subagent prompts for `workspace-packcrafter-ai` and `workspace-fairseed-rankings` to improve performance/reliability: switched to performance-aware startup reads (conditional daily-memory loading), tightened execution defaults, and standardized higher-signal output structure; also normalized `workspace-packcrafter-ai/USER.md` timezone/preferences to match Tristan.
- AgentMail inbox `waddbot@agentmail.to` is now the active personal inbox for this agent; user requested to stop using the old ClawThrall email identity.
- Added new security-focused skill `skills/agentmail-secure-inbox/` for safe send/list/read operations with strict untrusted-email handling and prompt-injection risk flags.
- Added new automation skill `skills/subagent-channel-provisioning/` to enforce one Discord channel per non-main subagent (mapped as `#<agent-id>` in `Subagent Channels`) and require visible kickoff/completion logs in those channels.
