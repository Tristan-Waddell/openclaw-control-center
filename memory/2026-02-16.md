## Durable updates
- Generated FairSeed nationwide lead deliverables:
  - `fairseed_leads_200.csv` (200-row lead sheet)
  - `fairseed_leads_200_notes.md` (sourcing approach + caveats)
- Added reusable skill: `skills/lead-finder-general/` with:
  - `SKILL.md`
  - `references/query-patterns.md`
  - `references/qualification-rubric.md`
  - `assets/lead_sheet_template.csv`
- Ongoing infrastructure note: gateway is consistently running, but service config still warns about nvm-managed Node path; recommended remediation remains `openclaw doctor --non-interactive` (or `--repair`).
- New preference from Tristan: for content/copy requests like LinkedIn posts, route through the `communications` subagent first, then return the result.
