## Durable updates
- Generated FairSeed nationwide lead deliverables:
  - `fairseed_leads_200.csv` (200-row lead sheet)
  - `fairseed_leads_200_notes.md` (sourcing approach + caveats)
- Added reusable skill: `skills/lead-finder-general/` with:
  - `SKILL.md`
  - `references/query-patterns.md`
  - `references/qualification-rubric.md`
  - `assets/lead_sheet_template.csv`
- Ongoing infrastructure note: gateway is consistently running, but service config still warns about nvm-managed Node path; recommended remediation remains `openclaw doctor --non-interactive` (or `--repair`).
- New preference from Tristan: for content/copy requests like LinkedIn posts, route through the `communications` subagent first, then return the result.
- Communications style preference: avoid formulaic contrast phrasing like “It isn’t X, it’s Y.” in generated copy.
- Applied the copy-style rule directly to `workspace-communications/AGENTS.md` under structural red flags to enforce it at prompt level.
- Added new reusable skill `skills/secure-web-browsing/` to enforce untrusted-content handling and prompt-injection-safe web research defaults.
- User preference: automatically use `secure-web-browsing` whenever a web link is accessed or whenever web content may be untrusted/high-risk.
- Content preference update: for communications copy, route through `communications` subagent; avoid implying experience in strategy/product/operations; keep recruiter-facing copy shorter and punchier.
