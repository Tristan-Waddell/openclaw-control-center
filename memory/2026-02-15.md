# 2026-02-15

## Durable updates
- Tristan clarified subagent intent: `packcrafter-ai` and `fairseed-rankings` are internal context assistants for the main agent, not customer-facing products.
- Updated both subagent workspaces (`/root/.openclaw/workspace-packcrafter-ai` and `/root/.openclaw/workspace-fairseed-rankings`) to reflect business-specific roles and explicit internal-assistant framing in `AGENTS.md`.
- Added continuous-learning workflow to both subagents: read `MEMORY.md` + daily notes at start; write back after meaningful tasks; keep stable truths in `MEMORY.md` and evolving context in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- Initialized subagent daily memory files for 2026-02-15 in both subagent workspaces.

## FairSeed lead-gen context (useful)
- Tristan wants high-school league administrator leads as FairSeed buyers.
- Verified NCHSAA staff directory yielded direct commissioner/championship/admin contacts (including named emails), plus GHSA and NFHS org-level routing contacts/pages for expansion.
